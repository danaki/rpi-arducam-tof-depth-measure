A project using a low-cost Arducam ToF depth camera with a Raspberry Pi to measure the area of circular objects. It can be used to measure the cross-sectional area of timber logs for estimating wood volume.

Place the circular object along the optical axis of the camera (in the center of the screen), launch the UI, adjust the necessary threshold values using the sliders, and click the "Measure" button. The measurement result will include the area of the shape in mmÂ², as well as the lengths of the semi-major axes a and b in mm for an area-equivalent ellipse (for manual size verification).

The measurement error of the Arducam ToF depth camera, depending on environmental conditions, typically does not exceed 10%.
